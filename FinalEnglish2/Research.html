            <h2>The Original Plan and What Happened?</h2>
            <p>The original plan for the investigation was to go to three supposedly haunted locations. The first being an abandoned asylum in Wauwatosa, where the group and I would explore for a bit and use the equipment I brought in order to try and capture any paranormal activity. The second location was going to be The Seven Bridges Trail in Cudahy, we would walk along the trails and go under the bridges and once again attempt to catch some sort of evidence with the devices. Finally, the third location was going to be The Pfister hotel in Downtown Milwaukee where I rented a room for the night. Unfortunately, everyone I invited decided to not show up so I had to change the plans. Rather than going alone to all three locations, I decided to invite my friend Ivy over and we played with the Ouija board, attempting to get some sort of evidence of the supernatural. So rather than including a video that I recorded, above I placed the video that we watched prior to beginning out investigation.

            We began to play at around 11pm on May the 12th. We started to record on both of our phones (keep this in mind for later) one phone showed the board and the other showed us and our background. The board was lit by only candle light in order to make it “spookier”. We each placed two fingers from each hand on the planchette and began the session by welcoming whomever wanted to speak to us. It began very slow, nothing much was captured but the ambiance did make me very nervous. We asked simple yes and no questions and to those we received no responses. I believed that the planchette was going to more but only due to an ideomotor effect and not an actual non-human presence. We were getting very close to ending the session out of frustration of not getting anything until I felt a hand on my shoulder. This became a sort of turning point of the night. I of course, freaked out a bit but continued our session. We began to get some responses to our questions, although not all of them were very intelligent responses. At around midnight we decided to end the session and move the planchette to say goodbye. The flames on the now partly melted candles flickered and it sounded as if someone began to walk up the stairs. The footsteps came as a surprise since my house was empty and no one was supposed to be coming home until the next day. I decided to do something stupid, something that causes everyone to yell at the characters in the scary movies, I grabbed my phone and recorded myself heading towards the door that leads to the stairs. I opened the door and saw nothing, no one was there, Ivy and I decided that we would no longer catch anything else that night so we stopped the videos and decided to grab some snacks. We grabbed our snacks and went back into my room, we relaxed for a bit, watched a horror movie and just spoke. That is when we heard a glass shatter, which was a cup that seemed to fall off of the table, I got a bit frightened because I left no glasses out and my cat was nowhere near the kitchen. Overall, the night was quite fun and we thought we got some great footage. Turns out the video I recorded corrupted and the one Ivy recorded cut off briefly after we lit the candles.
