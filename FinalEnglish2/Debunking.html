                Spirituality is a word with no set in stone definition. The Cambridge dictionary defines it as deep feelings and beliefs in a religious nature rather than the physical ones, the Oxford dictionary says it is something that relates to the soul instead of material objects and the Collins dictionary defines it as peoples’ thoughts and beliefs opposed to physical surroundings. All of these definitions have one thing in common, the belief that there is more to life than just the physical aspects of it. The majority of so-called “spiritualists” believe in a link between those on earth and those who have passed away. These people attempt to contact the dead in a wide array of ways. They either use older methods like dowsing rods, bells, recording devices or newer inventions such as spirit boxes, EMF meters and cat balls. Every tool used to contact the dead has some flaw, more specifically human error and later on electronic interference. The way new tools locate ghosts is by measuring magnetic fields, which is based on the idea that ghosts possess electromagnetic energy. An electromagnetic field is caused by moving electrical charges, such as those produced from household electrical appliances. As tools used for ghost hunting evolve and focus more on finding magnetic fields, the less accurate results will be. This means that most if not all evidence that has been collected regarding the supernatural must be looked at with a degree of skepticism. Until a more reliable sort of science emerges, the most compelling evidence for the existence of ghosts is often personal experience, which obviously is somewhat problematic.
